Look who we are, we are the dreamers
We make it happen, 'cause we believe it
Look who we are, we are the dreamers
We make it happen 'cause we can see it

Gather 'round now, look at me (Hayya, hayya)
Respect the love the only way (Hayya, hayya)
If you wanna come, come with me (Hayya, hayya)
The door is open now every day (Hayya, hayya)
This one plus two, rendezvous all invited
This what we do, how we do
